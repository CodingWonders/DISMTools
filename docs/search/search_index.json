If you are coming from this utility to DISMTools, here are some changes: User interfaces MSMG Toolkit is a terminal user interface (TUI) front-end with menus that you can operate by pressing a keyboard button. This is still intuitive, but not as much as a graphical user interface (GUI) front-end; which DISMTools and other UIs are. Operations With MSMG Toolkit, you have to copy the files from a Windows Setup disc to the ISO folder of the Toolkit launch directory and specify a Windows image to customize. With DISMTools, however, you don't have to. You only have to copy the Windows image you want from the sources directory of the Windows Setup disc to any location, create a project, and mount the image to it. If you've loaded a Windows image into MSMG Toolkit and closed it, the program will unmount it. If you force the closure of the program and launch it again, it will remove EVERY file from the Windows image, making it invalid and unrepairable . This can be done because the Toolkit is launched as TrustedInstaller by default. You don't need to worry about that with DISMTools. After mounting an image to a project, it will stay there, even if you close the program; until you want to unmount it. Also, the program will leave the mounted images alone when starting up, apart from reloading their servicing sessions if the images need a remount.

The Windows Imaging format (WIM for short) made installation and management faster and easier, since WIM files would contain an entire Windows installation; as opposed to the old method of copying files from installation media. With Windows Vista, Microsoft also introduced the Automated Installation Kit (AIK), which contains the deployment tools necessary for that operating system. Tools, such as ImageX (deploys images), Package Manager (deploys packages), IntlCfg (configures regional settings) or more; were included with this kit. However, Microsoft wanted to create a solution that would streamline the deployment process. Their answer was the Deployment Image Servicing and Management (DISM) tool, which does every action performed by the aforementioned utilities in a single command-line program. DISM was released alongside Windows 7, and has been improved since; with the addition of the API, PowerShell cmdlets and more. Nowadays, if you want to manage Windows images, DISM is one tool to master. Interfaces A couple of DISM graphical user interfaces have been developed to simplify tasks with DISM. The most well-known tool is NTLite , which allows you to integrate packages, features and updates; and allows for unattended installations.

First steps After installation has completed, you may run the program. The following steps are recommended to be done in order to get started Creating your first project With the program up and running, you'll begin by creating a project . Use the first link in the main screen, or go to File -> New project... You'll see the following screen, in which you need to provide a name and a location. After providing data on both fields, click OK. The project will be created and you'll be at the project screen. To load this project later, go to \"Open an existing project...\" and specify the project location. If you have loaded a project recently, it's added to the Recents list. To access a project, double-click its entry in the list; and to remove an entry select it and click Remove entry. Loading a Windows image The first thing you need to do after creating a project is to load an image to it. There are 2 ways to do this: Mounting a Windows image To mount a Windows image, either click the \"Mount image...\" button, or click the link in the left panel. You'll see this screen: Specify the source image file you want to mount and the path you want to mount the image to. You can also configure more settings from this dialog, if you wish. Follow the image mount guide for more information. INFO: the easiest way of getting a Windows image is by extracting the sources\\install.wim file from Windows installation media. This can be easily done by mounting the ISO in the File Explorer or by using 3rd party tools, like 7-Zip. Once you're done, click OK and wait for the image to be mounted. Finally, you have finished! Loading an already existing mount directory Since DISMTools 0.2, the program lets you load a mount directory and use it in your project if you've already mounted a Windows image to it. To do this, switch to the \"Image\" tab on the left and click the link on the bottom. Next, specify the mount directory and click OK. That's it! To look for available mounted images, use the mounted image manager . NOTE: since version 0.3.2, the aforementioned link will open a popup mounted image picker, instead of a folder browser, that makes this process easier. Simply select a mounted image from the list and click OK: Best practices When creating a project and/or managing Windows images, consider these best practices: Project paths Store your project on a location whose length is not greater than the MAX_PATH path length limitation (260 characters) A great place to store your project on would be at the root of your preferred drive, or in a folder 1 level deep. Such examples would be: D:\\ or E:\\Projects\\ You can disable this limitation if you're using Windows 10, version 1607 or later, by following these guides DISM operations An antivirus program may prevent you from doing an image task, so it's recommended to set an exclusion to the mount path of the image It's not recommended to mount more than 20 images at the same time, as it can cause significant performance degradation You must run this program and, at any time, DISM as an administrator, no matter what privileges you may have If you have mounted the image with write privileges enabled, it's best to commit your changes often. That way, if the image becomes corrupt, it's easier to recover it It's not recommended to store files on network shares, as it can be faster to perform most operations if the files are copied to a local disk Servicing from Windows PE If you plan on servicing images from a Windows Preinstallation Environment (WinPE), consider these requirements while planning your strategy: Booting Windows PE from a local disk: you can allocate additional memory to your Windows PE installation when booting it from a local disk, to increase performance; and you can create temporary folders to store large updates Booting Windows PE from read-only media: if you plan on booting the Windows PE installation from optical media, ensure that your computer has enough memory Add a page file to your PE installation: to improve memory management, consider creating a page file. See the wpeutil command reference for more information Specify a scratch directory: for some operations, like adding packages, it is best to create and specify a scratch directory to store temporary files on.

Otherwise, you may get error code 0xc1570113 . More information can be found here . You may also need to properly register the application to the operating system for it to fully work, a guide for which is explained later in this page. This action is supported on DISMTools 0.2 and newer Usage Add any application file you want to add to a Windows image, which can be in the .appx , .msix , .appxbundle or .msixbundle format, to the AppX package list . This can be done by using the buttons on the bottom of the dialog, or by dropping them from an elevated application. If an application contains dependencies, be sure to add these to the AppX dependency list , by using the buttons below or by dropping them from an elevated application App Installer support DISMTools 0.3.2 expands the AppX addition capabilities by supporting App Installer files. Simply specify an .appinstaller file or drop it in the package addition list view, and let the program deal with it. You can learn more about App Installer files here . Encrypted application support DISMTools 0.5 introduces the ability to add encrypted application packages ( .eappx , .emsix , .eappxbundle , and .emsixbundle files) to active installations . Simply add those, just like you would with regular applications. For standard encrypted applications (not bundles), you can also view standard information about them, thanks to a modified version of UnpEax : Encrypted application bundle package support will come in a future version. You may notice that all options are disabled. This is because the program uses a PowerShell command to add these applications, as they can't be added using DISM. Options A license file may be required for an application to be installed, which you can specify in the license file text box. Otherwise, select \"Skip license\" If you want, you can provide a custom data file If you want to provision applications in some regions, specify them, separated by a semi-colon (;); following the ISO 3166-1 Alpha 2 or Alpha 3 codes NOTE: specifying a region requires DISM for Windows 10 and/or a Windows 10 or later image. If you want, you can commit the image after adding the selected AppX packages . Questions Q: Where can I download app packages? A: You can make use of the Microsoft Store Generation Project and the web version of the Microsoft Store . Follow these steps: Load the Microsoft Apps website and search for the application you are looking for Once you've found your desired application, copy its link . It will be useful for the generation project Load the generation project website and paste the link you've copied If the server returns results, download the desired version of the AppX package and its dependencies If your browser complains about the safety of the files, confirm you want to download them. Q: I've installed an application on an online installation using this method, but the application doesn't work. Why? A: This may occur because the application is not fully registered. To do this, you need to make use of the registry and PowerShell: Open the Registry Editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications and grab the name of the application you want to register Next, open PowerShell as an administrator and type the following: Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\" | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (where *<PackageName>* is the name of the package you want to register) If the command complains about %SYSTEMDRIVE% being in the Path value, replace it with the drive you've booted to, like this: (Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\").Replace('%SYSTEMDRIVE%', 'C:').Trim() | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (obviously, replace \"C:\" with your boot drive) If the command complains about a missing dependency, download it, then add it using DISM, then use the same procedure The application should be fully registered now. Do note that the application will still not work if you are logged into the built-in Administrator account. In that case, you need to create a new user.

Follow these steps: Load the Microsoft Apps website and search for the application you are looking for Once you've found your desired application, copy its link . It will be useful for the generation project Load the generation project website and paste the link you've copied If the server returns results, download the desired version of the AppX package and its dependencies If your browser complains about the safety of the files, confirm you want to download them. Q: I've installed an application on an online installation using this method, but the application doesn't work. Why? A: This may occur because the application is not fully registered. To do this, you need to make use of the registry and PowerShell: Open the Registry Editor, go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications and grab the name of the application you want to register Next, open PowerShell as an administrator and type the following: Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\" | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (where *<PackageName>* is the name of the package you want to register) If the command complains about %SYSTEMDRIVE% being in the Path value, replace it with the drive you've booted to, like this: (Get-ItemPropertyValue -Path 'HKLM:\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Appx\\AppxAllUserStore\\Applications\\*<PackageName>*\\' -Name \"Path\").Replace('%SYSTEMDRIVE%', 'C:').Trim() | Add-AppxPackage -DisableDevelopmentMode -Register (obviously, replace \"C:\" with your boot drive) If the command complains about a missing dependency, download it, then add it using DISM, then use the same procedure The application should be fully registered now. Do note that the application will still not work if you are logged into the built-in Administrator account. In that case, you need to create a new user.","title":"Questions"},{"location":"img_tasks/appx/add_provisionedappxpackage/#related-topics","text":"Command-line help","title":"Related topics"},{"location":"img_tasks/appx/appx/","text":"Overview of AppX packages With Windows 8 , Microsoft introduced a new kind of applications, Metro-style apps, that work with the operating system's new interface and design guidelines. These apps are packed in the AppX format, and can be deployed with DISM or with the PowerShell cmdlets provided by the Appx module. DISMTools 0.2 introduced AppX package servicing, which allows you to add and remove these applications to and/or from Windows images and/or online installations. Inside an AppX package NOTE: this information is based on how applications are packed in the MSIX format, but this also applies to AppX packages. An overview of the MSIX packaging format can be accessed here . However, this information focuses on more technical things about these packages This is the overall structure of an AppX package: Source: Microsoft However, the placement of some files varies depending on the format of the application: .appx and .msix packages contain the manifest on the root of the package, as AppxManifest.xml .appxbundle and .msixbundle packages store the manifest as AppxBundleManifest.xml , under the AppxMetadata directory We are interested in the manifest file because it provides information about the application : its name, its publisher info, its version and, most importantly, its dependencies. NOTE: if you've ever stumbled upon an .eappx or .emsix package, these cannot be opened or deployed through DISM , and need to be deployed using the Add-AppxPackage cmdlet Let's look at a manifest file. This is the manifest file of Rayman Jungle Run : If you can't read the selected text, here it is in code view: <Identity Name=\"UbisoftEntertainment.RaymanJungleRun\" Publisher=\"CN=C6D89DF1-FB66-4AAD-9100-AD9BE1186BE1\" Version=\"1.2.0.88\" ProcessorArchitecture=\"x86\" /> This is the information you'll see when adding AppX packages with DISMTools: The aforementioned line of XML code can be located on line 3 of the manifest, or on line 10 if a comment begins on line 3. Now, how can DISMTools detect the store logo asset ? By using the manifest file. Shortly after the XML code mentioned, a <Properties> tag begins, which contains information about the package display name (or how it will be shown on the start menu), the display name of the publisher , and the location of the store logo asset . Based on the last property, DISMTools goes through the AppX package and extracts the store logo asset, if it can. Otherwise, it will show a generic icon. The location of the store logo asset also varies depending on the format of the application. In .appxbundle and .msixbundle packages, it is stored in another AppX package inside its parent package, in which the store logo asset can be extracted from the same location. With the store logo asset on hand, DISMTools copies it to a store logo asset cache, so that it doesn't extract the asset again if it exists in the cache. App Installer files At some point you may run into this type of package and wonder what it is. App Installer files are XML files that declare the download URL for the main package (which is usually a bundle file). Let's look at them: INFO: you can view the structure of these files in any text editor, like Notepad What we're interested in is the <MainBundle> section, which defines the package name, publisher, version, and the main package download URL. Here is an example: <MainBundle Name=\"Microsoft.WinDbg\" Version=\"1.2306.12001.0\" Publisher=\"CN=Microsoft Corporation, O=Microsoft Corporation, L=Redmond, S=Washington, C=US\" Uri=\"https://windbg.download.prss.microsoft.com/dbazure/prod/1-2306-12001-0/windbg.msixbundle\" /> The Uri property is what matters.

For more information, go to the image unmount page. Reloading the servicing session/repairing the component store Depending on the state of the mounted image, the program will let you do one task or the other. If its status is Needs remount , you will be able to reload the servicing session of the mounted image If its status is Invalid , you may be able to repair the component store of the mounted image. The ability you have depends on whether the image can be repaired or not. If it can't be repaired, your only choice is to discard it Enabling write permissions If you want to make changes to a read-only mounted image, you need to enable write permissions . This process will unmount the image and then mount it with write permissions. Do note that the image must be present in its location and must not be in read-only media in order for this process to complete successfully. Accessing the mount directory This will open the mount directory in File Explorer, allowing you to browse the files of the Windows image. This is similar to an active installation, so don't delete any files you don't know what they do. Removing volume images If the mounted image contains more than 1 index, you are able to remove volume images from it easily. Specify the indexes to remove, and click OK. For more information, refer to the volume image removal page. Loading mounted images If you've opened a project with no images loaded, you can easily load the mounted image you want to the project.

You will then see an overview of the mounted images: Usage When you load this version of the mounted image manager, you need to mark an image for management . You can easily do this by pressing the M key and selecting an image using its number. If the list was modified in the background, you'll see an updated list. After marking an image, you can then perform management actions with it. Tasks These are the tasks you can do with this version of the mounted image manager: If you want to switch to another image, you can mark it (M key) Depending on the status of the image (R key): If it needs a servicing session reload ( Status: NeedsRemount ), you can reload it If it needs a component store repair ( Status: Invalid ), you can repair it When you've finished working with an image, you can unmount it (U key) You can access its mount directory (A key) If the image contains multiple indexes (volume images), you can remove those from it (V key) or switch to another index (S key, DISMTools 0.3.3 and later ) If images were mounted or unmounted from an external program, you can update the mounted image listing (L key) If the image is mounted with read-only privileges, you can enable write permissions (E key) Then, press ENTER to perform an action. Unmounting an image NOTE: if the image is mounted with read-only privileges, this action will directly unmount it discarding changes In this menu: You can commit the changes of an image and unmount it (C key) You can discard the changes of an image and unmount it (D key) You can configure unmount settings (S key) Unmount settings NOTE: these settings only apply to the commit operation. You can't change settings for read-only mounted images. These are the same settings you would find in the image unmount dialog . Configure them as you like and press ENTER to perform the unmount operation. Removing volume images NOTE: this task is only applicable to images with multiple indexes In this menu you can mark the volume images (indexes) to remove (M key) and proceed with the removal operation (P key). Do note that proceeding with the volume image operation will unmount the image discarding changes . Make sure you have saved them before beginning. During this operation, you can view the image that is being removed. Once this process finishes, you'll go back to the main menu. Marking volume images to remove From the image index list shown above, you can pick the volume images to remove by specifying its number. You can specify multiple indexes by separating numbers with commas ( , ). Finally, press ENTER: Switching indexes NOTE: this task is only applicable to images with multiple indexes In this menu you can specify the target index to mount (S key), specify the unmount operation (C key) and proceed with the switch operation (P key). Specifying the target index From the image index list shown above, you can pick the target index to mount by specifying its number. Finally, press ENTER: Enabling write permissions This is an automated process that unmounts a read-only mounted image and mounts it again with write permissions. Make sure the location of the source image file is still available before proceeding .","title":"Mounted image manager"},{"location":"img_tasks/tools/mimgmgr/#mounted-image-manager","text":"The mounted image manager allows you to manage your mounted images easily.
