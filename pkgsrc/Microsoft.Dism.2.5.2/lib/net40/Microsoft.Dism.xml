             <param name="packageIdentifier">Optional. A valid DismPackageIdentifier Enumeration value. DismPackageName should be used when the Identifier parameter is pointing to a package name, and DismPackagePath should be used when Identifier points to the absolute path of a .cab file. If Identifier field is not NULL, you must specify a valid PackageIdentifier parameter. If the Identifier field is NULL, the PackageIdentifier parameter is ignored.</param>
             <param name="limitAccess">A Boolean value indicating whether Windows Update (WU) should be contacted as a source location for downloading files if none are found in other specified locations. Before checking WU, DISM will check for the files in the SourcePaths provided and in any locations specified in the registry by group policy. If the files required to enable the feature are still present on the computer, this flag is ignored.</param>

             <param name="cancelEvent">Optional. You can set a CancelEvent for this function in order to cancel the operation in progress when signaled by the client. If the CancelEvent is received at a stage when the operation cannot be canceled, the operation will continue and return a success code. If the CancelEvent is received and the operation is canceled, the image state is unknown. You should verify the image state before continuing or discard the changes and start again.</param>

             <remarks>If the feature is present in the foundation package, you do not have to specify any package information. If the feature is in an optional package or feature pack that has already been installed in the image, specify a package name in the Identifier parameter and specify DismPackageName as the PackageIdentifier.If the feature cannot be enabled due to the parent feature not being enabled, a special error code will be returned. You can use EnableAll to enable the parent features when you enable the specified features, or you can use the DismGetFeatureParent Function to enumerate the parent features and enable them first.
            
             If the feature to be enabled is not a component of the foundation package, you must add the parent optional package with the DismAddPackage Function before you enable the feature. Do not you specify a path to a .cab file of an optional package that has not been added to the image in the Identifier parameter. If you specify a package that has not been added, and you specify DismPackagePath as the PackageIdentifier, the function will complete successfully but the feature will not be enabled.

             Mounting an image from a WIM or VHD file that is stored on the network is not supported. You must specify a file on the local computer.
            
             To mount an image from a VHD file, you must specify an ImageIndex of 1.
            
             The MountPath must be a file path that already exists on the computer. Images in WIM and VHD files can be mounted to an empty folder on an NTFS formatted drive. You can also mount an image from a VHD file to an unassigned drive letter. You cannot mount an image to the root of the existing drive.
            
             When mounting an image in a WIM file, the image can either be identified by the image index number specified by ImageIndex, or the name of the image specified by ImageName. ImageIdentifier specifies whether to use the ImageIndex or ImageName parameter to identify the image.

            Describes the architecture and hardware that the driver supports. The DismGetDriverInfo Function returns an object that includes an array of DismDriver structures. If you specify a DriverPath using the published name of the driver installed in the image, for example OEM1.inf, the array includes only the applicable hardware and architectures that are installed in the image. You can also specify a DriverPath using the source location of an .inf file on the technician computer. If you use the source location, the array includes all of the supported architectures and hardware that exist in the .inf file before it is installed to an architecture-specific image.

            </summary>
            <remarks>It is not recommended that you add and subtract values from the SYSTEMTIME structure to obtain relative times. Instead, you should
            <list type="bullet">
                <item><description>Convert the SYSTEMTIME structure to a FILETIME structure.</description></item>
                <item><description>Copy the resulting FILETIME structure to a ULARGE_INTEGER structure.</description></item>
                <item><description>Use normal 64-bit arithmetic on the ULARGE_INTEGER value.</description></item>
            </list>
            The system can periodically refresh the time by synchronizing with a time source. Because the system time can be adjusted either forward or backward, do not compare system time readings to determine elapsed time. Instead, use one of the methods described in Windows Time.</remarks>
